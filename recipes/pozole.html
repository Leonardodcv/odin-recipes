    <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican stew typically made with pork or chicken, but this vegetarian version calls for a Plant-based Protein Starter from Pure Farmland® instead. You can serve this hearty dish, topped with cilantro, avocado, and radishes, for lunch or dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini, diced (about 2 cups diced, about 10 oz whole)</li>
        <li>1 pound Pure Farmland® Simply Seasoned Plant-Based Protein Starters</li>
        <li>1 ancho chile in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons adobo sauce from can</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mild chile powder</li>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can yellow hominy, drained</li>
        <li>2 leaf (blank0)s bay leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch Kosher salt, as desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat a large Dutch oven or 
            pot over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 
            then onion, celery and garlic. Cook 3 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally, then add the zucchini. Cook 
            5 more minutes, until zucchini is slightly softened, 
            then remove from heat. Transfer vegetables to a plate 
            and reserve.</li>

        
        
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Return pot to medium heat. 
            Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, then Protein 
            Starter. Using a wooden spoon, break apart into 
            pieces about 1/2-inch big. Cook 8 to 10 minutes or 
            until Protein Starter is lightly golden. Add ancho 
            chile, adobo sauce, ground cumin, and chile powder. 
            Cook 2 more minutes, breaking up ancho chile with 
            spoon.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add vegetable broth, 
                hominy, bay leaves, oregano, and reserved 
                vegetable mixture. Bring to a simmer over 
                medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low 
                heat and cook 10 to 12 minutes or until 
                vegetables are tender. Season with kosher salt, 
                if desired.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> To serve, top with cilantro 
            leaves, diced avocado, and radishes. Serve with lime 
            wedges and tortilla chips, if desired.</li>
